               I am a dedicated academician and researcher with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, specializing in Resource Allocation in IoT Cloud Environments\
                using Swarm Optimization, and over five years of teaching experience at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

              </p>
              <p>
                As a multidisciplinary researcher, my interests lie in the Internet of Things (IoT), 
                Drone Technologies, AI-Driven Agriculture, Embedded Systems, and Cloud Computing. I have authored multiple publications in reputed conferences, journals, and book chapters with international publishers such as Springer, Wiley, and CRC Press. I have also filed and been granted over 10 national and international patents, particularly in drone technology and IoT-based smart systems, and have received several project grants under MHRD and university funding schemes. I actively contribute to academia and industry-focused innovation by serving as a reviewer, editor, keynote speaker, and mentor.

              </p>
              <p>
                As a faculty member at DEI, I have independently taught a wide range of core and advanced subjects, 
                including Big Data Technologies, Cognitive Robotics, Applied Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and 
                Cryptography and Network Security. I also possess hands-on expertise in programming (Python, C/C++, Java), web and mobile development, and hardware integration for IoT and drone-based systems.

              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond my academic and research endeavors, I have successfully led and supervised student innovations and projects in areas such as air quality monitoring, precision farming, mobile robotics, and drone-assisted services. My skill set also includes technical writing, drone piloting, embedded systems, full-stack web development, and mobile app developmentâ€”areas I continuously explore to stay aligned with emerging technological trends.

              </p>
              <p>
                This portfolio serves as a comprehensive reflection of my journey through research, teaching, technological innovation, and academic contributions. It highlights not only my scholarly achievements but also my commitment to developing impactful, real-world IoT and AI solutions for sustainable development.
