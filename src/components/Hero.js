              I am a dedicated academician and researcher with a Ph.D. in Computer Science,
              specializing in Resource Allocation in IoT Cloud Environments using Swarm Optimization,
              and over five years of teaching experience at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
            </p>
            <p>
               As a multidisciplinary researcher, my interests lie in the Internet of Things (IoT),
              Drone Technologies, AI-Driven Agriculture, Embedded Systems, and Cloud Computing.
              I have authored multiple publications in reputed conferences, journals, and book chapters
              with international publishers such as Springer, Wiley, and CRC Press. I have also filed
              and been granted over 10 national and international patents.
            </p>
            <p>
               As a faculty member at DEI, I have independently taught a wide range of subjects,
              including Big Data Technologies, Cognitive Robotics, Applied Machine Learning,
              Cloud Computing, and Cryptography and Network Security. I also possess hands-on expertise
              in programming (Python, C/C++, Java), web and mobile development, and hardware integration
              for IoT and drone-based systems.
            </p>
              <p>
             Beyond my academic and research endeavors, I have successfully led and supervised student
          innovations and projects in areas such as air quality monitoring, precision farming,
          mobile robotics, and drone-assisted services. My skill set also includes technical writing,
          drone piloting, embedded systems, full-stack web development, and mobile app developmentâ€”
          areas I continuously explore to stay aligned with emerging technological trends.
        </p>

           This portfolio serves as a comprehensive reflection of my journey through research,
          teaching, technological innovation, and academic contributions. It highlights not only my
          scholarly achievements but also my commitment to developing impactful, real-world IoT and
          AI solutions for sustainable development. </p>
